<h1><font size="5"><font color="skyblue">You decided to take the beer, you didn't realize before what could happen and you weren't thinking ahead.  About a week after you took the beer, the principal and your basketball coach came and talked to you about drinking the beer.  They said underage drinking was illegal and because of your actions, you got kicked off the team. <br> Remember, never let your friends pressure you into anything that could affect you in a negative way.  Sometimes what may seem right, may not actually be right.  </h1>
