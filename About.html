<font color="blue">We are some people from Girls Who Code who all had the same idea for an app, or website. Our idea is/was a website telling people how to be safe in various situations. Also known 
as Adventure Safety.when we first started our projest, we realized our project would be a lot more complex than the other projects. It took a while to decide who was doing what, and what we were goinga  to be using, a website, or an app.finally we decided....*drumroll please* A website!!! When we started, we wanted a lot more time, but we didn't, so, we really had to work hard. An amount of time, sessions, and brain breaks later, we present to you, </font>
